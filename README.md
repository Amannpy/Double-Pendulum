# Interactive Double Pendulum Periodicity Finder

This is a demonstration of interactively dropping a double pendulum at various points outlined on a heatmap, which shows the degree of chaos exhibited by the specific drop angle.

## Features
- **Lyapunov Exponent Heatmap**: A heatmap that describes the sensitivity to initial conditions of each drop angle.
- **Interactive Double Pendulum Simulation**: Hover over points on the heatmap and see the corresponding animations.
